The exercise provides an opportunity to problem-solve, apply your technical skills in solution design, communicate 
and extend or modify an existing system. Use of the whiteboard is strongly encouraged. 

Consider the problem of programming a bank of elevators, for example, in a ten floor building with one elevator. Each floor 
has two buttons to call the elevator to the floor to take you up or down. What are the fundamental algorithms and data structures 
one should build to control the elevator? Illustrate these pieces by writing code for the various user interactions with the 
elevator (calling it to go up/down, user pressing a floor within the elevator) as well as the actions of the elevator (moving 
up and down responding to user requests). Pseudocode is acceptable.

Walk through your code and the underlying assumptions you made as well as a couple of test scenarios. Time permitting, discuss how 
you would alter your approach as new requirements or constraints are added, such as multiple cars, express elevators, service floors, etc.
